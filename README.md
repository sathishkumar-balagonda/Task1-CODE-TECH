Project Overview: Basic Calculator in Python

Introduction :
This project involves the development of a basic calculator using Python. The calculator performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The main aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of Python programming for creating simple, functional applications.

Features :

1. User Interface : A text-based interface that prompts the user to input their desired operation and numbers.
2. Operations : Supports the following operations:
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (*)
   - Division (/)
3. Error Handling : Includes basic error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
4. Float Support: All operations handle floating-point numbers, allowing for decimal inputs and results.

# Implementation :

The program is structured into the following components:

1. Input Handling: The program captures user input for the operation and the numbers involved. It validates the input to ensure it is suitable for processing.

2. Function Definitions : The core arithmetic operations are defined as separate functions. Each function takes two numerical inputs and returns the result of the operation.
    - def add(x, y): returns the sum of x and y.
    - def subtract(x, y): returns the difference of x and y.
    - def multiply(x, y): returns the product of x and y.
    - def divide(x, y): returns the quotient of x divided by y, with handling for division by zero.

3. Main Loop : The program runs in a loop, continually prompting the user for input until they choose to exit. It uses conditional statements to call the appropriate function based on the user's input.

4. Output : After performing the desired operation, the program outputs the result to the user.

# Example :
The user is prompted to enter their choice of operation and the numbers they wish to operate on. The program then performs the calculation and displays the result. For example:

Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Result: 5 + 3 = 8

Conclusion :
This basic calculator project demonstrates how Python can be used to create a simple and functional application. It reinforces fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, function definitions, loops, and error handling.
